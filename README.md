# Testing GraphQL with Rocket in Rust

This repository just contains some code I used to test GraphQL with Rocket. 
You might see some weird and bad code practises in the code but that is just the code from the examples directory of juniper :)

### Requirements
- Rust and Cargo installed.
- Rustup version 1.23.1 or above

### Building from source

- **Download or Clone the repository**
```shell
git clone https://github.com/tejasag/testing-graphql-rocket
```

- **Switch to nightly build of rust** <br/>
```shell
rustup override set nightly
```

- **Run the code**
```shell
cargo run
```

I am pretty sure that's it for now lmao
